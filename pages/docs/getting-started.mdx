# Getting Started

## Key Concepts

To spin a conversation around/on any element of the Web, Convo needs two central parameters,
- An origin `url`: This sets which website the message is coming from.
- A `threadId`: This sets the context (an anchor) around what is being talked about, An article, A transaction, An NFT, A Post, really could be anything. Convo recommends following [community standards](/docs/Convo-API/standards) around common elements like Ethereum Addresses, NFTs etc, but this value can be implemented in anyway an application likes. This helps maintain a common thread of thought throughout the web.

## Choose Your Adventure
