# Embeddable Convo

## Introduction

Any thread created on Convo can be embedded as an interactive comments section on any website, using an iFrame.

Refer [here](/integrate/Convo-API/api-docs), if you are looking to build a custom interface instead of using an iframe.


## Integration

Start by simply copying the embed code for any thread by clicking the `Embed` button with link icon on any thread. The link in iframe embed code should be in a format like this,


```html
<!-- Link Format -->
https://theconvo.space/embed/t/<thread-id>?<customization-options>
```

Example,
```html
<iframe src="https://theconvo.space/embed/t/KIGZUnR4RzXDFheXoOwo?title=false&theme=dark" allowtransparency="true" width="100%" height="600px" style="border: none;">
  Comments
</iframe>
```

Now you can use this snippet on any website by simply inserting this HTML wherever you want the comments page to appear.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  Here it is recommended to set `allowtransparency="true"` in the iframe to automatically adapt to the color scheme of the page.
</Callout>
