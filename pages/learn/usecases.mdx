# Use Cases

The Convo Space is the Decentralized Conversation Layer of Internet offering all the tooling and infrastucture to build Social Platforms around any element of the web, powered by Web3.

Here are some of the use cases that Convo enables,
- Add a conversation layer to your platform to allow the community to interact, without worrying about the Complexities of Web3.
- Composable conversations across multiple interfaces. You can anchor one or many conversations to an NFT so that whichever Marketplace/Platform that NFT is viewed on the Community around that NFT can move along with it.
- Commenting on a specific transaction on Etherscan warning users of a malicious account/contract and having those conversations show up in your wallet so that the next time you are sending a txn to that address you can see the entire community warning you against it.
- Conversations around a Proposal are happening across a multitude of interfaces, with Convo you can build a plugin of Snapshot or any Governance Interface and continue those conversations anywhere.
- Convo's Identity and Reputation Layer makes it simple to move your Reputation across different interfaces, like a Prominent Artist who has sold multiple pieces can join a DAO and automatically unlock perks based on their sales and other on-chain activity.
- and many more...
