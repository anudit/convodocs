# The Convo Space

**The Decentralized Conversation Layer of Internet**

With Convo you can create a Comments section customizable for websites, connecting conversations and communities across the Internet.

 - Decentralized System : The Convo Space is intended to be fully decentralized, utilizing Textile's ThreadDB built on IPFS and Libp2p for Storage ensuring that your data lives independent of the interface.
 - Extensible Framework : Convo can be used as a singular layer to manage your conversations throughout the Internet and can be used to build upon and integrated into any application with Convo's API.
 - Community Governed : Moderation powered by Conviction Voting is a crucial part of the system to ensure the dialogue between participants is effective and governed by the people and not the platform.
