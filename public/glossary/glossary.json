This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user's wallet information safe.",
    "encryption": "There are many types of encryption, but for our purposes, it is a process that combines the text to be encrypted (plaintext) with a shorter string of data referred to as “a key” in order to produce an output (ciphertext). This output can be “decrypted” back into the original plaintext by someone else who has the key.",
    "epoch": "An epoch, in general, is a measure of time, or of blockchain progression, on a given blockchain. For the Ethereum Beacon Chain, an epoch consists of 32 slots, each lasting 12 seconds, for a total of 6.4 minutes per epoch. There is additional functionality built upon the epoch measure in the Beacon Chain to help ensure security and proper operation of the Chain.",
    "ether (eth)": "Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain network. Ether—also referred to as ETH (pronounced with a long “e”, like “teeth” without the “t”)—functions as a fuel of the Ethereum ecosystem by acting as a medium of incentive and form of payment for network participants to execute essential operations. The cryptocurrency of Ethereum has a lowercase e. The plural of ether is just ether; its abbreviation is ETH, with a space: I have 10 ETH.",
    "ether (denominations)": "There are a number of denominations of the currency we know as 'ether' or ETH; for the definitive explanation, see the original Ethereum Homestead documentation here.",
    "exchange": "A place to trade cryptocurrency. Centralized exchanges, operated by companies like Coinbase and Gemini, function as intermediaries, while decentralized exchanges do not have a central authority.",
    "fiat currency": "Government-issued currency. For example, US Dollars (USD), Euros (EUR), Yuan (CNY), and Yen (JPY).",
    "final, finality": "A transaction is considered “final” once it can no longer be changed. In a sense, this happens once there are sufficient confirmations of the transaction, but for all intents and purposes, a transaction is final once the block that contains it is mined or validated. Keep in mind that this reflects a fundamental rule of blockchains: unlike traditional financial systems where charges can be “reversed”, there is no “undoing” a transaction on the blockchain. Once finality is reached, the transaction is immutable.",
    "gm": "simply meaning “good morning,” gm is a common greeting used in crypto circles",
    "halving": "Many cryptocurrencies have a finite supply, which makes them a scarce digital commodity. For example, the total amount of Bitcoin that will ever be issued is 21 million. The number of bitcoins generated per block is decreased 50% every four years. This is called “halving.” The final halving will take place in the year 2140.",
    "hardware wallet": "A physical device that can be connected to the web and interact with online exchanges, but can also be used as cold storage (not connected to the internet).",
    "hexadecimal": "Hexadecimal is a base 16, rather than base 10, counting system. Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and letters A B C D E F.",
    "hot wallet / hot storage": "A wallet that is directly connected to the internet at all times, for example one that is held on a centralized exchange. Hot wallets are considered to have lower security than cold storage systems or hardware wallets.",
    "immutability": "The inability to be altered or changed. This is a key element of blockchain networks: once written onto a blockchain ledger, data cannot be altered. This immutability provides the basis for commerce and trade to take place on blockchain networks.",
    "light client": "A client that downloads only a small part of the blockchain, allowing users of low-power or low-storage hardware like smartphones and laptops to maintain almost the same guarantee of security by sometimes selectively downloading small parts of the state.",
    "mnemonic phrase": "See 'seed phrase / secret recovery phrase'.",
    "node (full node)": "Any computer connected to the blockchain network is referred to as a node. A full node is a computer that can fully validate transactions and download the entire data of a specific blockchain. In contrast, a “lightweight” or “light” node does not download all pieces of a blockchain's data and uses a different validation process.",
    "ommer block": "Under the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, miners received rewards for being the first to mine a new block. However, at times a block would be mined just after, and in competition with, the last block; this block, known as an ommer and previously as an uncle, could get rolled into subsequent blocks and the miner of the original ommer would get a partial block reward. All of this functionality is deprecated as of the Beacon Chain.",
    "optimistic rollup": "A rollup that assumes the validity and good faith of transactions, and only runs a fraud proof in the case of fraud being alleged. See also 'rollup'.",
    "permissioned ledger": "A blockchain network in which access to ledger or network requires permission from an individual or group of individuals, as opposed to a public blockchain. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners. Consensus on a permissioned ledger is conducted by the trusted actors, such as government departments, banks, or other known entities. Permissioned blockchains or ledgers contain highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is much easier to maintain and considerably faster than a public blockchain. For example, Quorum or Hyperledger Besu are permissioned ledgers that can be more easily set up for large enterprises. In contrast, the public Ethereum blockchain is a permissionless ledger which anyone can access.",
    "private blockchain": "A blockchain or distributed ledger that has a closed network where participants are controlled by a single entity. A private blockchain requires a verification process for new participants. A private blockchain may also limit which individuals are able to participate in consensus of the blockchain network. See also 'permissioned ledger'.",
    "private currency": "A currency or token issued by a private individual or firm. Typically, the token or currency is limited to use within the network of that particular firm or individual. This is not to be confused with a “privacy cryptocurrency” which are cryptocurrency with specific privacy features, such as hidden user identities.",
    "public blockchain": "A globally open network where anyone can participate in transactions, execute the consensus protocol to help determine which blocks get added to the chain, and maintain the shared ledger.",
    "rollups": "Rollups (pronounced “roll ups”) are one element in the set of tools and infrastructure being built as Layer 2, the scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They consist, in general, of solutions in which the transaction data is still kept on Layer 1, the original Ethereum network, while transaction computation occurs on a side network, freeing up computational power on Layer. There are different ways of approaching this problem from a technical point of view, namely Zero Knowledge, or ZK, rollups, and Optimistic rollups. See the entries on both of these types of rollup for more, and more in-depth discussion here.",
    "self-executing": "Functioning by itself, not controlled by any other party other than itself. Self-executing smart contracts cut costs/overhead by removing the need for an arbitrator and trust toward a third party.",
    "serialization": "The process of converting a data structure into a sequence of bytes. Ethereum internally uses an encoding format called recursive-length prefix encoding (RLP).",
    "sidechains": "A sidechain is what it sounds like — it is a separate blockchain that is Ethereum-compatible. While a sidechain is a sort of scaling tool, as a class they aren't part of Layer 2; they simply represent a way in which developers can build and enable cheaper transactions for the user (on the sidechain, in sidechain-native tokens or currencies) while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum network. This often requires routing tokens through a special portal or bridge, as sending tokens from a sidechain to Ethereum mainnet or vice versa would result in token loss.",
    "slashing condition": "Under a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, a slashing condition is one that causes the validator's deposit to be destroyed when they trigger it. See also 'Proof of Stake'.",
    "slot": "A slot, on the Ethereum Beacon Chain, is a 12-second period of time during which a new block may (or may not) be proposed. Every 32 slots composes an epoch. See also 'epoch'.",
    "smart contracts": "Smart contracts are programs whose terms are recorded in computer code. While they often contain agreements or sets of actions between parties that emulate a traditional legal contract, they are not, in and of themselves, legal documents. Smart contracts are automated actions that can be coded and executed once a set of conditions is met, and are the dominant form of programming on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.",
    "staking": "In the Ethereum context, 'staking' of tokens or currency carries the traditional meaning of 'setting aside currency for a determined purpose'; however, 'staking' can happen in a variety of venues with different effects. For example, on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), there is no centralized authority or bank putting up the funds to allow transfers to happen between parties; rather, the parties amongst themselves have to establish liquidity pools in order to facilitate swaps. In this context, someone might 'stake' tokens into a liquidity pool, often for a promised rate of return in exchange for the use of their tokens, with the option to withdraw their tokens later.On the Beacon Chain and Ethereum 2.0, 'staking' means something a bit different: 32 ETH may be staked at a determined smart contract address in order to operate a validator on the Beacon Chain; in this way, you help ensure the good functioning and safety of the network, and are rewarded for your staking.",
    "state": "The set of data that a blockchain network strictly needs to keep track of, and that represents data currently relevant to applications on the chain.",
    "state channels": "State channels are part of the set of tools and platforms involved in scaling Ethereum and enabling Layer 2. While a complex topic, state channels are essentially methods through which the current 'state' of the blockchain can be exported, and based on that any given number of transactions can take place off-chain, and then be moved back onto the main Ethereum chain.",
    "transaction block": "A collection of transactions on a blockchain network, gathered into a set or a block that can then be hashed and added to the blockchain.",
    "transaction fee": "A small fee imposed on some transactions sent across a blockchain network. The transaction fee is awarded to the miner that successfully hashes the block containing the relevant transaction.",
    "trustless": "'Trustless' is a term that gets used a lot in the decentralized web, and it deserves some explanation. Traditionally, to call something 'trustless' would sound like a negative thing. In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a third-party repository of 'truth' in whom trust resides. We don't rely on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. In a way, the rules and assurances built into the blockchain provide the basis for greater trust, because the system works the same for everyone.",
    "validator": "A participant in Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. On the Beacon Chain, validators need to stake 32 ETH, that is to submit a sort of security deposit, in order to get included in the validator set. See also 'staking'.",
    "validity proof": "The proof submitted along with certain types of rollups to prove that the transactions are valid. See also 'rollups'.",
    "xdai chain": "xDai Chain (xDai or Gnosis Chain) is a proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum sidechain that offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. The native token of xDai Chain is DAI which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and was created by MakerDAO.",
    "zk-snark": "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge are an incredible technology, and vital to the scaling of blockchain technology and the decentralized web. They are mathematically complex and can be daunting; this explanation from the Ethereum Foundation is a good primer."
