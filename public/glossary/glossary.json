There was little to no user interaction or user-generated content.","Web2":"starting in the 90s, the “read-write web” is characterized by user-generated content and improved user interfaces. This led to the creation of blogs and social media platforms, as well as sites like Wikipedia and YouTube. Web2 placed more emphasis on user experience and interoperability between different applications and websites, giving us the vast network of connected websites and resources that we are familiar with today.","Web3":"the next iteration of the web being ushered in as we speak, which leverages blockchain technology, open-source applications, and the decentralization of data and information.

Not to be confused with a fork, soft fork, software fork, or Git fork.","Hash":"A fixed-length fingerprint of variable-size input, produced by a hash function.","HD wallet":"A wallet using the hierarchical deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP-32).","HD wallet seed":"A value used to generate the master private key and master chain code for an HD wallet.

Therefore, it cannot receive or hold ether, or store data. A library serves as previously deployed code that other contracts can call for read-only computation.","Lightweight client":"An Ethereum client that does not store a local copy of the blockchain, or validate blocks and transactions.

NFTs can represent ownership of digital or physical assets.","Ommer":"A child block of an ancestor that is not itself an ancestor. When a miner finds a valid block, another miner may have published a competing block which is added to the tip of the blockchain. Unlike with Bitcoin, orphaned blocks in Ethereum can be included by newer blocks as ommers and receive a partial block reward. The term 'ommer' is the preferred gender-neutral term for the sibling of a parent node, but this is also sometimes referred to as an 'uncle.'","Parity":"One of the most prominent interoperable implementations of the Ethereum client software.","Private key":"See “secret key.”","Proof of stake (PoS)":"A method by which a cryptocurrency blockchain protocol aims to achieve distributed consensus. PoS asks users to prove ownership of a certain amount of cryptocurrency (their 'stake' in the network) in order to be able to participate in the validation of transactions.","Proof of work (PoW)":"A piece of data (the proof) that requires significant computation to find.
